  `Todd Morgan founded CoreIdentity Development Group Inc. to address what he identified as the defining infrastructure gap of the agentic era: the absence of a purpose-built control plane for autonomous AI execution. CoreIdentity is his answer to that gap — a vertically integrated enforcement stack built to institutional standards, from first principles, without compromise.`,
  `Todd brings an extensive background in National Intelligence and Department of Defense sectors, where he led complex, multi-entity operational programs requiring the highest standards of accountability, auditability, and governance under adversarial conditions. That experience forms the foundational design philosophy of every system CoreIdentity builds: enforcement first, evidence always, no exceptions for operational convenience.`,
  `Prior to CoreIdentity, Todd operated at the intersection of federal contracting, multi-entity organizational leadership, and technology deployment — managing portfolios and programs where failure was not an acceptable outcome. He applies that same operational standard to the infrastructure his company builds for enterprise and sovereign clients.`,
  `Todd built CoreIdentity through a period of profound personal adversity — a circumstance that sharpened rather than diminished his conviction that the right infrastructure, built correctly, can change outcomes at institutional scale. CoreIdentity is not a pivot or a pivot story. It is the deliberate construction of something that should exist and did not.`,
